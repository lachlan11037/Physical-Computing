<dd>What does a microbit do?</dd>
  A microbit is a pocket sized microprocessor that is programmed through the microbit website and is then uploaded to a hard drive on your computer which enables you to use the handheld device. It has 25 red LED lights that can flash messages and be used for certain games as well as two buttons (a and b) that enable you to control the events that occur.
