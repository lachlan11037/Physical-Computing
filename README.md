  <dt>What are microcontrollers?<dt>
 <dd>A microcontroller is a small, low-cost and self contained computer-on-a-chip that can be used as an embedded system. A few microcontrollers may utilize four-bit expressions and work at clock rate frequencies.<dd>
 <dt>Different types of micro controllers:<dt>

<dt>What does a microbit do?<dt>
  
<dd>A microbit is a pocket sized microprocessor that is programmed through the microbit website which you can then upload to a hard drive on your computer which then enables you to use the handheld device (after connecting the microbit with your comptuer). It has 25 red LED lights that can flash messages and be used for certain games as well as two buttons (a and b) that enable you to control the events that occur.</dd>

<dt>What does an ardunio do?<dt>
  
<dd> An ardunio is an open-source elctronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Ardunio boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message (are some examples of inputs) - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on a LED, or publishing something online (are some examples of outputs). Ardunio's consist of both a physical programmable circuit board and a piece of software and are primarily used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.<dd>

  <dt>What does a Raspberry PI do?<dt>

<dd> A Raspberry Pi is a credit card-sized computer originally designed for education, inspired by the 1981 BBC Micro. The Raspberry Pi is slower than a modern laptop or desktop but is still a complete Linux computer and can provide all the expected abilities that implies, at a low-power consumption level. The Raspberry PI is basically an upgraded version of the Ardunio as it runs the exact same way it does with extended capabilities and a better microcontroller overall.<dd>
