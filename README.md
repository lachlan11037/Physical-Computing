<dt>What are microcontrollers?<dt>
 <dd>A microcontroller is a small, low-cost and self contained computer-on-a-chip that can be used as an embedded system. A few microcontrollers may utilize four-bit expressions and work at clock rate frequencies.<dd>
 <dt>Different types of micro controllers:<dt>

<dt>What does a microbit do?<dt>
  
<dd>A microbit is a pocket sized microprocessor that is programmed through the microbit website which you can then upload to a hard drive on your computer which then enables you to use the handheld device (after connecting the microbit with your comptuer). It has 25 red LED lights that can flash messages and be used for certain games as well as two buttons (a and b) that enable you to control the events that occur.</dd>

<dt>What does an arduino do?<dt>
  
<dd> An arduino is an open-source elctronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message (are some examples of inputs) - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on a LED, or publishing something online (are some examples of outputs). Arduino's consist of both a physical programmable circuit board and a piece of software and are primarily used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.<dd>

# What are sensors?
  <dd>A sensor is a device that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment. The specific input could be light, heat, motion, moisture, pressure, or any one of a great number of other environmental phenomena. The output is generally a signal that is converted to human-readable display at the sensor location or transmitted electronically over a network for reading or further processing.<dd>

  <dt>What does a temperature sensor do?<dt>
  
<dd>A temperature sensor detects the temperature in a given radius around the sensor and then displays it. This is particularly useful in growing plants or cooking food that need to be done in a set temperature enviroment as the sensor will allow you to tell what the temperature is.<dd>

 <dd>Motion Sensor:</dd>

 <dt>What does a motion sensor do?<dt>
 
<dd>A motion sensor detects body heat (also known as infared energy) emitted from a living creature (animal or human) within a certain area that is usually preset by the owner of the motion sensor. Once something that emits infared energy enters that area, the sensor triggers an event (usually a loud alarm).<dd>
 
# What are actuators?
<dd>An actuator is a component of a machine that is responsible for moving and controlling a mechanism or system. They can be used to open hinges or move parts of a machine.<dd>
