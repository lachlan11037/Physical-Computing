  <dt>What are microcontrollers?<dt>
 <dd>A microcontroller is a small, low-cost and self contained computer-on-a-chip that can be used as an embedded system. A few microcontrollers may utilize four-bit expressions and work at clock rate frequencies.<dd>

<dt>What does a microbit do?<dt>
  
<dd>A microbit is a pocket sized microprocessor that is programmed through the microbit website which you can then upload to a hard drive on your computer which then enables you to use the handheld device (after connecting the microbit with your comptuer). It has 25 red LED lights that can flash messages and be used for certain games as well as two buttons (a and b) that enable you to control the events that occur.</dd>
