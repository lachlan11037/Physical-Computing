<dt>What are microcontrollers?<dt>
 <dd>A microcontroller is a small, low-cost and self contained computer-on-a-chip that can be used as an embedded system. A few microcontrollers may utilize four-bit expressions and work at clock rate frequencies.<dd>
 <dt>Different types of micro controllers:<dt>
  <dd>Microbit:</dd>

<dt>What does a microbit do?<dt>
  
<dd>A microbit is a pocket sized microprocessor that is programmed through the microbit website which you can then upload to a hard drive on your computer which then enables you to use the handheld device (after connecting the microbit with your comptuer). It has 25 red LED lights that can flash messages and be used for certain games as well as two buttons (a and b) that enable you to control the events that occur.</dd>

<dt>What does an arduino do?<dt>
  
<dd> An arduino is an open-source elctronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message (are some examples of inputs) - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on a LED, or publishing something online (are some examples of outputs). Arduino's consist of both a physical programmable circuit board and a piece of software and are primarily used to write and upload computer code to the physical board.<dd>

# What are sensors?
  <dd>A sensor is a device that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment. The specific input could be light, heat, motion, moisture, pressure, or any one of a great number of other environmental phenomena. The output is generally a signal that is converted to human-readable display at the sensor location or transmitted electronically over a network for reading or further processing.<dd>

<dt>Different types of sensors:<dt>
  <dd>Temperature Sensor:</dd>

  <dt>What does a temperature sensor do?<dt>
  
<dd>A temperature sensor detects the temperature in a given radius around the sensor and then displays it. This is particularly useful in growing plants or cooking food that need to be done in a set temperature enviroment as the sensor will allow you to tell what the temperature is.<dd>

 <dd>Motion Sensor:</dd>

 <dt>What does a motion sensor do?<dt>
 
<dd>A motion sensor detects body heat (also known as infared energy) emitted from a living creature (animal or human) within a certain area that is usually preset by the owner of the motion sensor. Once something that emits infared energy enters that area, the sensor triggers an event (usually a loud alarm).<dd>
 
# What are actuators?
<dd>An actuator is a component of a machine that is responsible for moving and controlling a mechanism or system. They can be used to open hinges or move parts of a machine.<dd>
 <dt>Different types of actuators:<dt>
  <dd>Electrical Powered Actuator:</dd>

  <dt>What does an electrical powered actuator do?<dt>
 
<dd>An electric actuator is powered by a motor that converts electrical energy into mechanical torque. The electrical energy is used to actuate equipment such as multi-turn valves. Additionally, a brake is typically installed above the motor to prevent the media from opening valve.<dd>

<dt>Different types of actuators:<dt>
 <dd>Motion Actuator:</dd>

 <dt>What does a motion actuator do?<dt>
 
<dd>A motion actuator is an actuator that powers itself when forced into an interaction with another object, like the actuator in an auto-shutting door.<dd>

# What are softwares?
<dd>Software is a general term for the various kinds of programs used to operate computers and related devices.<dd>
 <dt>Different types of softwares:<dt>
  <dd>Operating Systems (such as windows):</dd>

  <dt>What does windows do?<dt>
 
<dd>Windows is a group of several graphical operating system families that allows any other software to be run on the operating system as long as it's supported by windows. It is a renowned example of an operating system.<dd>
 
 <dt>Different types of softwares:<dt>
  <dd>Computer Softwares (such as microsoft word):</dd>

  <dt> What does microsoft word do?<dt>
 
<dd>Microsoft Word or MS-WORD (often called Word) is a graphical word processing program that users can type with. It is made by the computer company Microsoft. Its purpose is to allow users to type and save documents. Similar to other word processors, it has helpful tools to make documents. It is a renowed example of a computer software.<dd>

# The difference between analog and digital signals:
The difference between analog and digital is that analog signals are a continuous signal which represents physical measurements while digital signals are discrete time signals generated by digital modulation.

# Fantasy Device 
<dt>Chosen Fantasy Device: Mindreading Headpiece<dt>
 <dd>What is it?<dd>
<dd>The Mindreading Headpiece would be a device that looks extremely similar to circular headphones. Once I've put both muffs on my ears, it will block out any vocalised sounds and solely enable me to listen to what someone is thinking. To choose whos mind I tune into I just have to think of their face. They could be on the other side of the world and it wouldn't matter, I would know their deepest secrets and thoughts within seconds. I would probably use this just to make mischief.<dd>
